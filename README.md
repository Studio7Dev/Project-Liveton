# Project-Liveton

## What Is It?

Project Liveton is a GUI Based malware generator built with the intention of password stealing and discord token grabbing. Liveton has the ability to generate malware capable of dumping passwords saved on over 20 different Chromium-Based browsers directly into your email or discord server, disabling a Windows 10 machine, triggering a blue screen, and showing false errors (to make the application seem more believable), all while staying undetected by Windows Defender Firewall. Liveton was designed to make password stealing and token grabbing easy, and put the customizablity in to the hands of you, the user

### Powered by Microsoft's .NET framework
Liveton is able to generate payloads which avoid flagging the Windows 10 Defender Antivirus / Firewall, making it much easier to play off files as something other than a virus, whether it be an installer or maybe even a broken Valorant cheat.

Project Liveton can be purchased for $10 using your choice of either BitCoin or DogeCoin from our official Tor Website [Here](http://n52pdckeeqdxtwn7jhs6txpnrb23z6wfuvfg43yc6xdxwwnenonkmnad.onion/)
